# How to contribute to this open source project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project.

Contribution should be easy with small guidelines you need to follow. We would love
to accept your pull requests to this project by raising an issue in the
[issue list](https://github.com/authorjapps/zerocode/issues) or picking an existing issue.

The issue should clearly explain about the new or enhanced feature, or a bug fix.
Please follow these [simple guidelines](https://github.com/authorjapps/zerocode/wiki/Guidelines-for-raising-issues) here.

## How to submit a Pull Request (PR)

The commit messages should start with an issue number e.g. `ISSUE-14`, Then a `space`,
then `#`, then a `space`, then a `short` commit message `max of 70` characters.

example:

```
ISSUE-14 # SSL enabled http client
```

1. Best way to start is with opening a new issue describing the feature or a bug fix
   you intend to be available in the framework.

1. Follow the usual process of [forking][] the repo to work in.  
   Make sure you don't add any other feature or code which are not related to issue which is raised.
   This makes things clear for reviewer and a great time saver.

1. Cover your feature or bug fix code by good tests which are easy to understand. The
   project has already good amount of unit tests and integration test coverage, so please
   refer some of the existing tests if you are not sure how to go about it.

1. Please maintain a well-formed clean and consistent code for each commit.
   Avoid including any special characters in the commit messages. Do not make it too verbose.

1. Finally, push the commits from local machine to your repo and submit a [pull request][].

1. Please join our [mailing-lists][] and [gitter chat room][] for seeking community help.
